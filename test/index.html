<h2>Introduction Test 2</h2>

<p>From the battlefield of Mahabharata, Lord Krishna uttered the holy words of Bhagavad Gita, the epic of Indian spirituality which has inspired countless people over many centuries. The Bhagavad Gita holds immaculate relevance as natural imbalance is the biggest concern in life at present times. In chapter 7 (verses 4-6) Shree Krishna tells Arjuna about the duality of nature â€“physical and metaphysical. In chapter 10, Lord Krishna suggests his presence in every particle of the universe and informs mankind to nurture the nature henceforth; for only the assimilation of this principal can stimulate and rejuvenate the natural world. Chapter 17 and 18 give the message of attaining wholeness of being if we follow the principal laws of nature. Since the human body is made up of nature, the deviation from the natural causes disharmony in life and the world in general. The knowledge embedded in Gita is fathomable and logical. The sections seeming difficult also simply direct to infuse oneself with nature. Becoming companion of nature is an easy task for the mankind which is born and fostered by nature.  </p>
